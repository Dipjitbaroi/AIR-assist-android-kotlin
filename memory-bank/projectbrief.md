# AIR-assist Android App Project Brief

## Project Overview

AIR-assist is a voice-controlled AI assistant application optimized for hands-free use with Bluetooth headsets. The application is built with React Native for the frontend and Kotlin for the native Android modules, providing a modern, efficient, and maintainable codebase.

## Core Requirements

1. **Voice-Controlled Interface**
   - Users must be able to interact with the AI assistant using voice commands
   - The app must transcribe user speech to text
   - The app must convert AI responses to speech

2. **Bluetooth Integration**
   - Seamless connection with Bluetooth headsets and earbuds
   - Audio input/output through connected Bluetooth devices
   - Device discovery, pairing, and management

3. **AI Assistant Functionality**
   - Real-time communication with AI backend via WebSockets
   - Conversation history management
   - Offline message queuing for later processing

4. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive, distraction-free interface
   - Visual feedback for voice recognition
   - Customizable settings for personalization
   - Dark and light theme support

5. **Performance & Reliability**
   - Low latency audio processing
   - Reliable Bluetooth connectivity
   - Efficient battery usage
   - Graceful handling of network interruptions

## Technical Specifications

1. **Frontend**
   - React Native 0.79.2
   - Context API for state management
   - Component-based architecture
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

2. **Backend Integration**
   - WebSocket communication with AI server
   - JSON message format
   - Authentication and secure communication
   - Efficient binary audio data handling

3. **Native Modules**
   - Kotlin implementation for Android
   - Native audio recording and playback
   - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) integration
   - Permission management

4. **Data Management**
   - Local storage for settings and history
   - Efficient state management
   - Data persistence across app restarts

## Project Scope

## Stakeholders

- End users who need hands-free AI assistant access
- Development team
- Product management
- QA and testing team
- UX/UI designers

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints

- Android platform only
- Requires Bluetooth-capable devices
- Requires internet connectivity for full functionality
- Dependent on external AI backend service

### Assumptions

- Users have Bluetooth headsets or earbuds
- AI backend server is available and accessible
- Users have basic familiarity with voice assistants
- Android devices meet minimum requirements (Android 8.0+)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Bluetooth connectivity issues | High | Implement robust error handling and reconnection logic |
| Audio quality problems | High | Use high-quality audio codecs and processing |
| WebSocket reliability | Medium | Implement offline mode and message queuing |
| Battery drain | Medium | Optimize resource usage and background processing |
| Permission denials | Low | Provide clear explanations and fallback functionality |

## Dependencies
